# Mindfulness Survey Design

As part of my master's degree, **I designed a survey to study the effects of mindfulness intervention programs on students in New York City schools across different racial, gender, and socio-economic backgrounds.**


Mindfulness has been used as an educational tool for many years, with the aim of improving studentâ€™s wellbeing. However, not much research has been done on the differing effects of mindfulness interventions on students of different demographics.  The survey shown here builds on  previous research by including socio-economic status (SES), and racial backgrounds.  

This survey addresses the following main research questions: 
  *  What are the effects of mindfulness interventions for students with different racial, gender, and/or socio-economic backgrounds?
  *  Do mindfulness programs have similar effects across these demographics? Or are they more/less effective?
